Expected result (avg ns/square): 46 ns (8 clks/square @ 174 MHz)
Design documentation (below):
1. The Squarer is based on the Project from Ozturk

2. The adder three compression is improved: Originally, the adder tree is based on 3-to-2 CSA. Now it uses 6-to-3 CSA (which is better suited for 6-input LUTs). This reduces the number of logic levels in the adder three. 
The following files were added to the primitives to enable 6-to-3 CSA:
\primitives\rtl\carry_save_adder_6_3.sv
\primitives\rtl\carry_save_adder_tree_6_3_level.sv
\primitives\rtl\compressor_tree_6_to_3.sv
\primitives\rtl\full_adder_6.sv
Due to the change, also some adjustments in the main squaring file (modular_square_8_cycles.sv) were required. The final addition after the CSA adders has now three instead of two inputs (a three-input adder can be implemented in one carry-chain, it is therefore only little costlier than a two-input adder).

3. Small improvements in the existing main squaring file (modular_square_8_cycles.sv):
 - max_fanout attribute
 - "Pipelining" the main FSM so that the "next_state" signal is already a FF output. This way, control logic has easier timing.

4. Due to the modifications, the core clock frequency could be increased from 161 to 174 MHz (a run also reached 175 MHz)
