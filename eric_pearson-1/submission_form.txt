Team name: Eric Pearson
Expected result (avg ns/square): 31.5 nS, 4 cyc @ (64/63)*125 Mhz
Design documentation (below):
- Used same numeric representation, word length, and interface as in the provided reference.
- unrolled as 2 stage pipeline, with lut address = square product register. see: modular_square/model/pictures.txt
- Stage1: Parallel 1Kbit square unit based on 17bit DSP multiplier, with native CARRY8 adder trees
- Stage2: Parallel 2Kbit product modulus with both 8/9bit BRAMs and 5/6bit LUTRAM based word reduction roms, and native CARRY8 adder trees
- State machine controlled stage register enables and valid signals to give 2 clock cycles per stage. Multi-cycle timing constraints 
- State machine intialization delay of 4 cycles for starting value paths. Multi-cycle timing constraints
- Power savings by reset of modsqr unit upon while IDLE or upon completion of itterations.
- Power ramp up of 1ms by integrated ramp pulse modulated delay of state machine register enables.
- MMCM pll 101:102 clock multiplier (31.7ns) along with clock domain crossing logic in the wrapper. Max-delay timing constraints.
- Observed 124ps slack, which gives us 248 ps per modsq to lower our latencyA, so then
- STEPS.ROUTE_DESIGN.TCL.POST=update_pll.tcl which adjusts MMCM PLL to 64:63 giving us 31.5 ns latency 
- Timing closure is checked during bitstream generation and passes
